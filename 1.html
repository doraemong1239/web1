  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe" title="press this">The universe</a> is <strong>all of space and time and their contents, including planets, stars, galaxies, and all other forms of matter and energy.</strong>While the spatial size of the entire universe is unknown, it is possible to measure the size of the observable universe, which is currently estimated to be 93 billion light-years in diameter. In various multiverse hypotheses, a universe is one of many causally disconnected constituent parts of a larger multiverse, which itself comprises all of space and time and its contents; as a consequence, ‘the universe’ and ‘the multiverse’ are synonymous in such theories.<P>
